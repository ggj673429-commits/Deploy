### Option 2: Render (FREE TIER Available)

**Web Dashboard Method (Easiest):**
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Sign up/login
3. Click "New +" → "Blueprint"
4. Connect to GitHub repository
5. Render auto-deploys using `render.yaml`!

**Manual Render Method:**
```bash
# Run helper script
bash deploy-render.sh
```

### Option 3: Deploy with Docker (Any Platform)

**Using docker-compose (local or VPS):**
```bash
# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your values
nano .env

# Start everything
docker-compose up -d

# Run migrations
docker-compose exec backend alembic upgrade head

# Your app is live at:
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend: http://localhost:8001
```

## ⚙️ Required Environment Variables

Before deploying, you need:

### 1. JWT Secret Key (Required)
Generate one:
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```
Result example: `a7f3d9e2b8c4f1a6d5e9c3b7f2a8d4e1c6b9f5a2d7e4c1b8f3a9d6e2c5b8f4a1`

### 2. Database URL (Auto-generated by Railway/Render)
Will look like: `postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database`

### 3. Telegram (Optional - for admin notifications)
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` - Get from @BotFather
- `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` - Get from @userinfobot

---

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

Before deploying:
- [ ] Generate JWT secret key (32+ characters)
- [ ] Get Telegram bot token (if using Telegram features)
- [ ] Choose deployment platform
- [ ] Review `.env.example` and prepare your values

After deploying:
- [ ] Check backend health: `https://your-backend.com/api/health`
- [ ] Run database migrations: `alembic upgrade head`
- [ ] Create admin user: `python scripts/create_admin.py`
- [ ] Test login functionality
- [ ] Test wallet operations

## 🎯 Deployment by Platform

| Platform | Time | Cost | Best For |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **Railway** | 5 min | $5/mo | Fastest deployment |
| **Render** | 10 min | Free tier | Budget-conscious |
| **DigitalOcean** | 15 min | $12/mo | Full control |
| **AWS/GCP** | 30 min | Variable | Enterprise scale |
| **Docker (VPS)** | 20 min | Variable | Self-hosted |

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Railway token not working from CLI
→ Use the web dashboard or run scripts on your local machine

### "Cannot connect to database"
→ Make sure DATABASE_URL is set correctly and database is running

### "CORS error" on frontend
→ Add your frontend URL to CORS_ORIGINS in backend

### "Port already in use"
→ Change port in docker-compose.yml or kill the process
